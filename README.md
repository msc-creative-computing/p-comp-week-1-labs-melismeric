# Project: Mood-Board

I designed a speculative visual communication interface for astronauts to easily send messages to each other. Being in spaceflight for a long duration causes high psychological risks. Dangers, deprivation, isolation may be harmful to astronauts' psychology. There is always danger during spaceflight, and living longer with the danger increases astronauts' perception of it. Yet, because of the psychological training they become adjust to this danger. ("Long Duration Psychology", 2021) However, I thought it would be beneficial for them to express their emotions and moods visually. It can help them attract attention or be left on their own. That is, it can enable others to understand the mood/state of the user and take action accordingly.

The interface may help them communicate both in the spaceship or outside of the spaceship during a mission. Astronauts use special space suits while they are on a mission. It is hard to communicate during these missions, and sometimes audio communication may not be enough. This interface can be attached to the space costumes of astronauts working with helmets that hide their facial expressions. It is useful for sending small but urgent messages from a visible distance. It will be easier to use than communicating with sound because it works only with one button. 

## How does it work?

The interface consists of red, yellow, and blue colored LEDs and a button. Each press to the button turns on one type of colored LEDs. With the first press, just the red LEDs turn on. With the second press, red LEDs turn off, and yellow LEDs turn on. With the third press, blue LEDs turn on, and the others turn off. Three colors represent different moods or situations. 
* Red: alarmed/danger/anger
* Yellow: happiness
* Blue: sadness/calmness 
("Color symbolism - Wikipedia", 2021)

For example, while on a mission an astronaut turns on the red light, which will mean they are in danger. When the other astronaut sees the red light they will know that they need to do something immediately. Also when everything is going fine during the mission the astronauts can turn on the yellow or blue light. However, the meanings of the colors can change when they are used in the spaceship. An astronaut can turn on a blue light in the spaceship, meaning they are not feeling fine and need to be alone. Red will mean they are angry, and yellow will mean they are happy.

I decided on the color codes from universal meanings of colors. However, these colors can also represent different messages predetermined by astronauts(or other users).

This interface may only be useful if the users can perceive colors. Yet, it can also be used to communicate with other living creatures in space.
